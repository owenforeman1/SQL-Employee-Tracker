# SQL-Employee-Tracker

## Description

I wanted to make an easy to use command line app to see the full scope of a business. You can view roles, departments and employees as well as adding anyone of those things. I learned a lot about mysql and using schemas and seeds. I also learned a lot on how to interact with the backend of an app.

## Installation

You need node and mysql to run this app. Once you have node clone the repo and open it. Change the password in prompts.js to your mysql password. Source schema and seeds to get a database then run the application with node server.js.
